                    RMC has 4 depots in the whole galaxy, and one of them doesn't even work. They are very heavily pirated, and there is good reason for it:
                    RMC has beryl restock, and gold profits, so its easy to see why its pirated. information for the escorts, and how to properly run this route will be below with the gold and drug information.

                <h2>Salvage</h2>
                <p>Reclaimer - ingame cost: 16m
                    Avg haul: 11m (you can get a bug to overfill it all the way to 13-15m)
                    Avg time: 1hr
                    best gameplay loop: 
                    Go to Yela, Crusader, and accept "Hammerhead Cleanup missions" or "risky C2, Hammerhead, A2, or M2" these missions will all be on Yela and can be chained together. You will want to have one of the cheap legal salvage missions to make sure you don't get trespassing or a crime stat. 
                    
                    If multiple groups are running these missions then youre better off server hopping or running legal missions. As long as you have the stock drive you will have no problem with fuel consumption.
                    
                    Solo running takes a while, it is reccomended to have 2 other players for a 3 way split
                    
                    1 Claw Man: Sits in the claw seat and makes sure the depot is full. Only goes to salvage processing if box boy really needs help. 
                    
                    1 Box Boy: You have the hardest job. You need to make sure you can stack as many 16 scu boxes inside of the salvage processing area as possible. If you're fast enough the game won't recognize that it needs to despawn boxes past 1800 scu. I will include a video with an indepth stacking tutorial to make sure yall are getting the best holds possible</p>
